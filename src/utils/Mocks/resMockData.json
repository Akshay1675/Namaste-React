    "brandLongDescription": "Rumour has it that Akhtar Bhai was the first one to sell samosas in Pune. We don’t know what the truth is, a bite of the delicious Mutton Samosa here and you won’t care either. The thin pastry (patti) casing is crisp, not too oily or greasy and generously stuffed. Highly recommended are the chicken and mutton samosa, both of which have spicy keema filling.",
